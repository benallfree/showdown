## What to Contribute

This is an open source course to teach people how to program. I welcome your contribution, especially if:

- It fixes bugs or clarifies confusion
- It serves the goal of learning to program

I am probably aware that there are different/better/newer approaches to the code and concepts in this course. The primary focus is to teach someone who has never programmed before. If you have an idea for an improvement that would involve extensive work, please contact me first to make sure it is likely to get accepted. I work to keep things simple and clear, even if there might be a more sophisticated approach or tool available.

## How to Contribute

1. Find the best `checkpoint-*` branch. Generally speaking, find the earliest checkpoint that could accomodate your change and use that one. If your change affects multiple branches, you should definitely talk to me first so we can coordinate the best way to update things.
2. Submit a PR against the checkpoint branch you chose. Make sure there are no merge conflicts. I'll review it and either merge it, leave comments, or decline it. If I decline it, I will politely tell you why it will continue to be declined no matter how much work you do on it.

Note: This course includes opportunities to contribute to the code base we develop together. Those opportunities will have separate instructions.
